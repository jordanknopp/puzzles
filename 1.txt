If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. 
The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Note some numbers are multiples of both 3 and 5 (e.g. 15)
Approach:
1.  Sum all multiples of 3, excluding any that are also multiples of 5.
2.  Then sum all multiples of 5.
3.  Combine these two sums.

sum_3 = 0
sum_5 = 0
for i in range(1,1000):
	if i%3 == 0:
		if i%5 > 0:
			sum_3 += i
			
for j in range(1,1000):
	if j%5 == 0:
		sum_5 += j
		
sum = sum_3 + sum_5
