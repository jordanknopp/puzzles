1.  Recognize palindromes
2.  Consider numbers that are products of two 3-digit numbers

Didn't want to deal with strings, so used division by 10,100,etc. to reduce number of digits and mod%10 to obtain last digit

largest = 0
for j in range(900,999):
	for i in range(111,j):
		p=i*j
		if ( (p/1000)%10 == (p/100)%10 ): #3rd and 4th
			if ( (p/10000)%10 == (p/10)%10 ): #2nd and 5th
				if ( (p/100000)%10 == p%10 ):
					if (p>largest):
						largest=p
