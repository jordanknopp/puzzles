1.  Remove line separations.
2.  In multiplication, 0 makes the product 0.  Delete all 0's.  Don't just remove them but mark with a new line!
3.  Delete any lines with less than 13 digits.  This means they were between zeroes and won't matter
4.  1's don't contribute anything.  They are literally HALF as useful than 2's, which are the next lowest contributor.  Find 13 adjacent numbers without 1's in them.
5.  This left me with 9 number strings to check.  Anything longer than 13 I picked whichever numbers would be more valuable.
6.  I really wanted to do this by hand.  And it worked!
