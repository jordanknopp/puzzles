How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?

12 months per year
100 years x 12 months = 1200 months
Expect 1/7 of these to be a Sunday
1200/7 ~ 171

Turns out this answer is correct...even though there is some shifting
(e.g. Feb being 28 days, which is divisble by 7, means that the 1st of Feb
and the 1st of Mar will be the same day of the week, except during leap years.
also in 1901, sunday was the first of the month 2/12 times, which is actually 1/6)

I imagine this evens out over the course of 100 years as all the "irregularities" of the
calendar are repeated evenly.
